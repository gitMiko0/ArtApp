# ArtApp

This React-based single-page application (SPA) is an interactive gallery exploration tool that allows users to browse and discover art collections. The app provides different views to explore artists, galleries, paintings, and genres while enabling users to sort, filter, and add favorites. Users can navigate between views seamlessly and view details about specific artworks in modals. The app retrieves data either from a web API (from Assignment 1) or directly from a Supabase database.
